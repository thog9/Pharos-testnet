# Pharos Testnet Scripts üöÄ

This collection of Python scripts empowers you to interact seamlessly with the Pharos Testnet, a cutting-edge blockchain test network for decentralized applications. The core script, main.py, offers an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) to perform a variety of operations, from deploying smart contracts to swapping tokens. Built with web3.py, these scripts leverage asynchronous execution and provide a modern, bilingual (English/Vietnamese) user experience.
